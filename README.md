# photo-blog

This is a photo blog page that i made using Bootstrap and CSS showcasing a few of my favourite musical acts from www.morrisonhotelgallery.com.

I used fonts for the different sections using Google Fonts and used CSS to make several transitions when you hover over them to distinguish them from one another.

The photos themselves have a border-radius transition when you hover over them.

The biggest lesson i took from this was how to use the Bootstrap grid system to separate content.
